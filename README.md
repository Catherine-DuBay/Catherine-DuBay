## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Catherine DuBay and I am an Economics major at the University of Notre Dame, set to graduate in 2027. I have minors in Foundations of Business & Computing and Digital Technologies. I am originally from Birmingham, Michigan. In my free time, I enjoy reading, travel, making playlists, and spending time with friends.
